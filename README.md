# Anomaly Detection Project

This project aims to compare different machine learning models for the task of anomaly detection. The goal is to identify which model performs best on a given dataset, and to provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each model. The project also aims to experiment with different data preprocessing techniques and hyperparameter tuning methods to improve the performance of each model.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is [IOT-23](https://www.stratosphereips.org/datasets-iot23).

## Models

The following machine learning models will be compared in this project:

- Isolation Forest
- KNN
- One-Class SVM

The metric chosen to compare the models is the [F1 score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score).



## Conclusion
